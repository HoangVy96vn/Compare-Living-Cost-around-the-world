# Compare-Living-Cost-around-the-world

Data source: Kaggle (This is a comparison of the cost of living in various cities, as gathered by popular siteÂ numbeo. All data belongs to them and has been shared with permission)

About original file (cost-of-living.csv), it's arranged in the way that easy for people reading, but impossible for progam reading. If you want to analyze these data, you need to transform it to table type which is easy for program to read. I used python to transform it. Please give me feedback if you find more suitable codes for this case. (Jupyter: Data transformation.ipynb)

I also attached file after transforming (Living Cost data clean.csv)

For Dashboard:
- Power BI file - Living cost by Cities in the World.pbix
- Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/views/Comparelivingcostamongcities/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
(I don't know why Tableau couldn't recognize places by Cities, so I transformed data into city and country for Tableau to read it)
